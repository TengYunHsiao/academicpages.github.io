I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student from the Department of Physics, at National Taiwan University. My research interests include machine learning, LLM, Data Pruning, and Curriculum learning.
I am very fortunate to have conducted undergraduate research on machine learning with **Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu**, under the advisement of **Han Liu**, in the MAGICS Lab, Department of Computer Science, Northwestern University, from 2023â€“2024. Furthermore, I have been advised by Professor **Miranda C. N. Cheng** from the University of Amsterdam and Academia Sinica, Taiwan since September 2024.
