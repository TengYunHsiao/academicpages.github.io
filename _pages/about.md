I'm a **fourth-year undergraduate student** from the Department of Physics, double majoring in the Trans-disciplinary Bachelor Degree Program (創新領域學士學位學程) at National Taiwan University. My research interests include **Physics for AI** and machine learning.
I am very fortunate to have conducted undergraduate research on machine learning with **Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu**, under the advisement of **Han Liu**, in the MAGICS Lab, Department of Computer Science, Northwestern University, from 2023–2024. Furthermore, I have been advised by Professor **Miranda C. N. Cheng** from the University of Amsterdam and Academia Sinica, Taiwan since September 2024.
